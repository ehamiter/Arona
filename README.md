Arona Theme for Sublime Text 2 and PyCharm
==========================================

Arona (*Maori: "colorful"*) is based directly off Chris Kempson's [Tomorrow-Night theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme), which he has graciously given me permission to alter.

Differences
-----------

Arona has a handful of additional syntax handling definitions, an overall clearer, darker contrast and a few color tweaks. 


Installation
------------

### Sublime Text 2
Copy **[Arona.tmTheme](https://github.com/ehamiter/arona/raw/master/Arona.tmTheme)** into your ST2 Color Scheme packages folder *(Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages... > Color Scheme - Default)*


### PyCharm
Download **[Arona.jar](https://github.com/ehamiter/arona/raw/master/Arona.jar)** and import it into PyCharm via *(File > Import Settings)*

It is set to use Menlo by default for compatibility's sake, but I recommend using my own [Edlo](https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo), because I think it's swell.
