Arona Theme for Sublime Text 2
==============================

Arona (*Maori: "colorful"*) is based directly off Chris Kempson's [Tomorrow-Night theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme), which he has graciously given me permission to alter.

*Font shown in screenshot above is [Edlo](https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo), and the theme is [Soda-Dark](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).*

Differences
-----------
Arona has a handful of additional syntax handling definitions, an overall clearer, darker contrast and a few color tweaks. 


Installation
------------

Copy **[Arona.tmTheme](https://github.com/ehamiter/ST2-Arona-Theme/raw/master/Arona.tmTheme)** into your ST2 Color Scheme packages folder *(Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages... > Color Scheme - Default)*
