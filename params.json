{"name":"Arona","body":"Arona Theme for Sublime Text 2 and PyCharm\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nArona (*Maori: \"colorful\"*) is based directly off Chris Kempson's [Tomorrow-Night theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme), which he has graciously given me permission to alter. \r\n\r\n\r\n![Arona screenshot](https://github.com/ehamiter/Arona/raw/master/arona.png)\r\n\r\n*Font shown in screenshot above is [Edlo](https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo)*\r\n\r\nDifferences\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nArona has a handful of additional syntax handling definitions, an overall clearer, darker contrast and a few color tweaks. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Sublime Text 2\r\nCopy **[Arona.tmTheme](https://github.com/ehamiter/Arona/raw/master/Arona.tmTheme)** into your ST2 Color Scheme packages folder *(Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages... > Color Scheme - Default)*\r\n\r\n\r\n### PyCharm\r\nDownload **[Arona.jar](https://github.com/ehamiter/Arona/raw/master/Arona.jar)** and import it into PyCharm via *(File > Import Settings)*\r\n\r\nIt is set to use Menlo by default for compatibility's sake, but I recommend using my own [Edlo](https://github.com/ehamiter/Edlo), because I think it's swell.","tagline":"A Sublime Text 2 / PyCharm pastel / dark theme","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
